## Beef Stew

This is a tasty beef stew that can be made in under an hour with the instant
pot. Good hearty flavor perfect for a rainy evening

### Ingredients

1. 2 cups all purpose | plain flour (240g)
2. 1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetener (60g)
3. 4 teaspoons baking powder (16g)
4. 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (1g)
5. 1/2 teaspoon salt (2g)
6. 1 1/2 cups milk (plus up to 1/4 cup extra if needed) (360g)
7. 1/4 cup butter , melted (60g)
8. 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract (8g)
9. 1 large egg

### Steps

1. Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
2. Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay). (The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency).
3. Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. 
4. Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.
5. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
6. Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!
